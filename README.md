🐶🐱 Cats vs Dogs Classification using SVM
📌 Overview

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle Dogs vs Cats competition
.

Instead of using deep learning (CNNs), this project demonstrates how traditional machine learning with feature extraction (HOG + color histograms) can be applied to image classification.

🚀 Features

Downloads dataset directly from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.

Extracts handcrafted features:

HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)

Color histograms (RGB space)

Trains an SVM classifier for binary classification.

Evaluates the model with accuracy and classification report.
